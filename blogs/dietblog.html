          <p>
            Milk is by far the best drink after water. We all have been instructed from our childhood to drink atleast a glass of milk everyday probably because of the rich nutritious & health benefits. Milk contains Casein , which gives the bones strength and builds them strong. Miik also brings with itself some very good products like butter, yogurt and shakes. So if u don't feel like drinking milk, trying one of it's bi=products is also a good healthy alternative choice.
