      <p>
        Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in
        React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL.
        The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel
        of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the
        community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did
        find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day
        but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot
        many people I know.
