            We all have done Cycling as kids, riding our bicycle everywhere to
            School, to play and to our friends home. Cycling does not only
            exercises ur legs, but helps building overall stamina and endurance
            in ur body, and the fun to ride it can not be compared with a geared
            vehicle.
